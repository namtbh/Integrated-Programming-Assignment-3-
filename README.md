Instructions for Using Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, and Max Heap.
Summary
This project has two Python scripts that show how to use different data structures.

File 1: file1. py - Creates a Binary Search Tree (BST) and an AVL Tree (a balanced type of BST). It has features to add nodes and find values in both BST and AVL trees, and it also compares how well a list, BST, and AVL tree perform.

File 2: file2. py - Creates a Max Heap to organize employee objects by their salaries, giving priority to those with higher pay. It has different types of employee classes, like Janitors, Programmers, and CEOs, and it gets the employees from the heap sorted by their salaries from highest to lowest.

Documents
file1py: Compares how searching works in a list, a Binary Search Tree, and an AVL Tree.
file2py: Uses a Max Heap to keep track of employee data and shows employees based on their salaries, from highest to lowest.
File 1: How to Use BST and AVL Trees (file1. py)
Characteristics
Binary Search Tree (BST): Lets you add and find whole numbers easily.
AVL Tree (Balanced BST): A type of binary search tree that keeps itself balanced automatically, making it faster for operations. Helps add and find things.
Comparing Search Speeds: Looks at how fast you can find things in a Python list, a binary search tree (BST), and an AVL tree.
How to Run
To run file1. py, use this command:

Sure. Could you please provide the text you'd like me to simplify.
Sure Please provide the text you would like rewritten in simpler words.
Run the file named "file1. py"
The script creates 150,000 random numbers and puts them into a list, a binary search tree (BST), and an AVL tree. Then, it looks for a random number in all three structures and notes how long each search takes.

Expected Result
The program will show how long it takes to search for a number in a Python list, a binary search tree (BST), and an AVL tree. It will also tell you if the number was found in each one.

Looking for the number: 452993
Search time for the list: 0. 000486 seconds - Result: Found.
Search Time: 0. 000017 seconds - Found: Yes
AVL Search Time: 0. 000009 seconds - Result: Found
File 2: Max Heap with Employee Classes (file2. py)
Characteristics
Employee Structure: Has different types of employee classes.
Employee: The main class for all workers.
Janitor, Programmer, CEO: These are special types of jobs that have extra features and actions.
Max Heap: Keeps employee information and sorts them according to their salary.
Heap Operations: Gets employees from the heap, sorted by their salaries from highest to lowest, and shows their job details and pay.
How to Run
To run file2. py, type this command:

Sure. Please provide the text you would like me to simplify.
Sure Please provide the text you'd like me to rewrite in simpler words.
Run the file named "file2. py"
The script puts different kinds of workers (like janitors, programmers, and CEOs) into a big heap and shows them from the highest salary to the lowest.

Sure "Expected Output" can be rewritten as "What you should see. "
The script will show each employee's job details and their pay, starting from the highest salary to the lowest.

Sure Please provide the text you would like me to rewrite in simpler words.

A makefile is a special file used in computer programming to organize and manage the building of software. It contains instructions that tell a program how to compile and link different pieces of code together.

Needs
Python version 3. 7 or higher
Use
This project can help you learn the following ideas:

Binary Search Trees (BST) are a way to organize data so you can find things quickly. This text talks about how to create and use them.
AVL Trees are a type of data structure used in computer science to store information. They automatically keep themselves balanced, which means they stay organized even when you add or remove items. This helps them work faster and more efficiently.
Polymorphism in Python with employee classes.
A Max Heap is a type of data structure that helps to organize things by giving priority to certain values, like salaries in this example.
Permission
This project is for learning only and doesnâ€™t have a special permission to use.
