# README for BST, AVL Tree, and Max Heap Implementation

## Overview
This project contains two Python scripts:

- **`file1.py`**: Implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) and an AVL Tree to add and search nodes, comparing their performance with a Python list.
- **`file2.py`**: Implements a Max Heap that organizes employees by salary, displaying them in descending order.

## Files
- **`file1.py`**: Compares search operations between a list, BST, and AVL Tree.
- **`file2.py`**: Uses a Max Heap to sort employee data by salary.

## How to Run
To execute:

```sh
python file1.py
sh
Copy code
python file2.py
file1.py: Inserts 150,000 random numbers into a list, BST, and AVL Tree, then searches and compares performance.
file2.py: Inserts various employees into a max heap and displays them by descending salary.
